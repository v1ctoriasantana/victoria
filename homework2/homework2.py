# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?
# Git is a version control system. GitHub is a clpud platform for hosting Git repositories, and Git Bash is a terminal for using Git commands on Windows.
# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?
# The terminal is a program that opens a command-line interface, while the command line is the text based interface itself where you type commands.
# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?
# PowerShell is a windows shell with scripting capabilities, while Git Bash emulates a Unix-like terminal to run Git style commands on windows.
# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?
# Ananconda is a python distribution for data science, cona is its package manager, and python is the programming language they are built around.
# 5) What is VS Code? 
# Visual Studio code is a code editor.
# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?
# A jupyter notebook is an interactive document for code and rich text, while JupyterLab is a more advanced interface that supports multiple notebooks, terminals, and files in one workspace.
# 7) What does ~/ mean?
# ~/ is a shortcut for the home directory of the current user.
# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
# Absolute Path: Full path from the root /, e.g., /home/username/projects/code.py Relative Path: Path relative to your current directory, e.g., ../code.py or projects/code.py
# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
# Absolute path: /home/yourusername/yourname/docs/notes.txt Relative path: docs/notes.txt
# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
# cd ../homework1/
# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
#It would attempt to remove the current directory, but rm does not delete directories by default.
# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add : Stages changes (files) to be committed.
# git commit : Saves the staged changes with a message to the repo history.
# git push : Uploads your committed changes to a remote repository like GitHub.

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
# git add . adds all changes in the current directory and subdirectories. git add <file> adds only the specified file to staging.
# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
# git status: Shows which files are staged, unstaged, or untracked.git log -1: Shows the most recent commit made in the repository.
# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
# Cloning (git clone): Creates a copy of a remote repository on your computer. Pulling (git pull): Fetches updates from a remote repo and merges them into your local repo.
# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
# Once I had an error where my terminal was telling me my python_decal_fa25 repository did not exist and it took me a second to realize it was because I had moved that folder onto my desktop and out of my files.
# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
# I am still a bit confused about the differences between repositories and individual files.
# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
# Honey doesn't spoil ! Archeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3000 years old and still edible.
# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
print(2 ** 10)  # This prints 1024, which is 2 raised to the power of 10

# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
