1. Topics that sound interesting:
- Exoplanets and the search for life
- Quantum computing
- Space debris tracking
- Black hole simulations
- Machine learning for climate modeling

2. Related sources:
- Exoplanets: NASA Exoplanet Archive — contains real discovery data about planets outside our solar system.
- Quantum computing: IBM Quantum Experience — an online tool to experiment with real quantum computers.
- Space debris tracking: ESA’s Space Debris Office publishes datasets tracking orbital debris.

3. Chosen topic: Space debris tracking
I could use Python to analyze orbital debris data — for example, looping over a dataset, filtering based on altitude, and plotting how debris accumulates over time.

4. Possible projects:
- Ambitious: Build a small dashboard (using matplotlib or Plotly) showing live orbital debris trends from a dataset.
- Realistic: Write a Python script that reads a CSV file of debris data and outputs statistics (average altitude, count by object type, etc.).
